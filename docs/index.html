    <h1>About the Game</h1>
    <p>Our project is a game 1-2 player game called Charlie and Charlindaâ€™s Wacky Adventure (name in progress) 
         that we are all creating in Unity using C# scripts to handle user input, enemy ai, character interactions, etc.
         The layout of each floor and room will be procedurally generated so that the player has a 
         new experience each time they play the game through from the 
         beginning to end. The player will  have access to various options that will allow them to have a unique customized experience, 
         such as changing the difficulty of their game and entering a speedrun mode. The game will also have three save file slots that will keep 
         track of top runs and achievements for each file. 
    </p>
